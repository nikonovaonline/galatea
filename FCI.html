        <p>Alaskan Malamute, one of the
        oldest Arctic sledge dogs, is a powerful and substantially built dog
        with deep chest and strong, well-muscled body. The Malamute
        stands well over the pads, and this stance gives the appearance of
        much activity and a proud carriage, with head erect and eyes alert
        showing interest and curiosity. The head is broad. Ears are
        triangular and erect when alerted. The muzzle is bulky, only slight
        diminishing in width from root to nose. The muzzle is not pointed or
        long, yet not stubby. The coat is thick with a coarse guard coat of
        sufficient length to protect a woolly undercoat. Malamutes are of
        various colors. Face markings are a distinguishing feature. These
        consist of a cap over the head, the face either all white or marked
        with a bar and/or a mask. The tail is well furred, carried over the
        back, and has the appearance of a waving plume. The Malamute
        must be a heavy boned dog with sound legs, good feet, deep chest
        and powerful shoulders, and have all of the other physical attributes
        necessary for the efficient performance of his job. The gait must be
        steady, balanced, tireless and totally efficient. He is not intended as
        a racing sledge dog designed to compete in speed trials. The
        Malamute is structured for strength and endurance, and any
        characteristic of the individual specimen, including temperament,
        which interferes with the accomplishment of this purpose, is to be
        considered the most serious of faults.</p>
