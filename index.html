            <h2>Hello! I am an Alaskan Malamute. My name is Galatea, but at home they call me Galya.</h2>
            <p>I love to eat delicious food, walk in the fresh air, run after hedgehogs, communicate with people and especially love to sleep. I am already 3 years old, I am an adult lady with my own character. More than anything, I would like to learn how to change my size so that I can travel with my guardian wherever she goes. I could shrink down to the size of a matchbox and sleep in her pocket while she works. Or become as big as a horse so we can have fun and quickly move around the city. If I had the opportunity, we would be together more often. But I'm not complaining, in the three years of my life, we already live in the third city, so I have enough adventures!</p>
